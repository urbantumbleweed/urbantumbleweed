#### Exercise 1 - How to tell a joke in 8 easy steps.

For every method below, write the method and use (a.k.a 'call') the method 2x (with different arguments).

Additionally, note / explain:
  * What input does this method take?
  * What does this method return?
  * What side effects does this method have?


1. Write a method that displays a joke to the user (you pick the joke).
  * (This method should have 1 line in the body.)

2. Modify the method so that it still displays the joke, but this time returns the string "joke told!" as well.
  * (2 lines)

3. Modify the method so that you can give it an arbitrary joke, which it will show to the user instead of the original joke.
  * (2 lines)

4. Modify the method so that, after displaying th
e joke, it takes user input from the terminal and stores it in a variable.
  * (Continue to return 'joke told!').

5. Modify the method so that it returns the user input.

6. Modify the method so that if the user input is "I don't know" it displays a snarky comment, otherwise, it says "you got my joke!"
  * continue to return the user input

** Paws **

7. Modify the method so that it returns true or false. It should return false if the user said 'I don't know", true otherwise.
  * continue to display snarky comment, "you got my joke"

8. Modify the method such that you can give it a 'correct response' to expect from the user. The method should behave as above, only now return true if the input matches the correct response, false otherwise.


#### Exercise 2

1. Write a new method called "tell_two_jokes". It should call our original method, and take 4 arguments, joke1, answer1, joke2, answer2.

# #### Exercise 3

# 1. Write a method that takes an array as input and returns "thanks for the sweet array!".

# 2. Modify this method to return the last element in the array.

# 3. Modify this method to return the middle element in the array.

# 4. Modify this method to take a second argument. Replace the middle element with the value of this argument. Puts the new array. Return the new array.

# 5. Modify this method to take a 3rd argument. This represents what index to replace in the array with the new element. Return the new array.

# 6. Add error handling. In case of an error, return false.
