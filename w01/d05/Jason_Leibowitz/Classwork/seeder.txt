Once upon a time therrre was a dik dik that lived in Afrrrica with all the otherrr dik diks. The otherrr dik diks werrre all bad dik diks and everrry day they ate zebrrras and wildebeests and everrry kind of antelope. Sometimes the bad dik diks ate people too. They ate Swahilis, Umbulus and Wandorrrobos and they especially liked to eat Hindu trrraderrrs. All Hindu trrraderrrs arrre verrry fat and delicious to a dik dik.
