Once upon a time therrre was a kitty that lived in Afrrrica with all the otherrr kittys. The otherrr kittys werrre all bad kittys and everrry day they ate zebrrras and wildebeests and everrry kind of antelope. Sometimes the bad kittys ate people too. They ate Swahilis, Umbulus and Wandorrrobos and they especially liked to eat Hindu trrraderrrs. All Hindu trrraderrrs arrre verrry fat and delicious to a kitty.
