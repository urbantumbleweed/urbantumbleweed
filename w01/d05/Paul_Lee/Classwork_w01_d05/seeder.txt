Once upon a time therrrrrrrrre was a dik dik that lived in Afrrrrrrrrrica with all the otherrrrrrrrr dik diks. The otherrrrrrrrr dik diks werrrrrrrrre all bad dik diks and everrrrrrrrry day they ate zebrrrrrrrrras and wildebeests and everrrrrrrrry kind of antelope. Sometimes the bad dik diks ate people too. They ate Swahilis, Umbulus and Wandorrrrrrrrrobos and they especially liked to eat Hindu trrrrrrrrraderrrrrrrrrs. All Hindu trrrrrrrrraderrrrrrrrrs arrrrrrrrre verrrrrrrrry fat and delicious to a dik dik.
