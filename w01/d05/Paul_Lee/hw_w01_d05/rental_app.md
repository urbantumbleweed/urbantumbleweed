#Rental App

###Objectives
* Practice creating objects and classes
* Practice using multiple files to separate your classes
* Practice with Object Oriented Programming
* Practice using arrays and hashes to model your data

###Prompt:
You will be creating an app that models the rental process. What types of objects might you have in an app that manages rentals? We are going to have a building, apartments and people.

###CODE FREEZE
** Take at least 30 minutes to map out and plan. The key to solving this is planning out your classes and choosing the right data structures to represent your objects**

_DO NOT WRITE A SINGLE LINE OF CODE UNTIL YOU HAVE MODELED YOUR CLASSES_

**Seriously, plan this one out. You will save yourself hours of frustration and confusion**

### Part 1 - Creating the classes

Create each of the classes for Person, Apartment, and Building

A person should have the following attributes:

* name
* age
* gender

An apartment should have the following attributes:

* name
* price
* sqft
* num_beds
* num_baths
* renter (the person living in the apartment)

A building should have the following attributes:

* name
* address
* num_floors
* apartments

You should determine what methods & behavior are needed for each of your objects. It may help to look at the functionality required below.

### Part 2 - Creating the program functionality & menu display

* The program should instantiate a new building when it starts
* The program should display the following menu options
  * Add an apartment to the building
  * Add a tenant
  * List the apartment directory for the building
  * Quit
* The program should return to the menu until the user quits

#### Adding an apartment to the building
* Make sure to get the appropriate input from the user to create your apartment
* Add the new apartment to the building

#### Adding a tenant to an apartment
* Make sure to ask which apartment they want to live in
* Add the person to that apartment

#### Listing the apartments
* List all of the apartments
