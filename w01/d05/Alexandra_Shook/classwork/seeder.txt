Once upon a time therrre was a dog that lived in Afrrrica with all the otherrr dogs. The otherrr dogs werrre all bad dogs and everrry day they ate zebrrras and wildebeests and everrry kind of antelope. Sometimes the bad dogs ate people too. They ate Swahilis, Umbulus and Wandorrrobos and they especially liked to eat Hindu trrraderrrs. All Hindu trrraderrrs arrre verrry fat and delicious to a dog.
