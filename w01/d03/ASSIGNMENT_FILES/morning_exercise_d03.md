###While Loops

Today you're going to write a few while loops that mimic the behavior of some of the arithmetic operators you used to make your calculators last night. The only operators you're allowed to use are **( `+` )** and **( `-` )**.

#####Take some time to map out the problem on paper or on your desk before you start to code.

#####MAKE SURE YOU ARE WORKING IN YOUR OWN FOLDER!!!

#####Multiplication

First you will mimic the **( `*` )** operator. The loop should prompt the user to enter two numbers: a base and a multiplier. The loop should print out the product of the two numbers **entered**. So if the user enters 2 and 3, then the while loop should print:

```
Enter a base number:
2
Enter a second number?
3

The answer is = 6

```

#####Division

Now for the division operator **( `/` )**. The loop should prompt the user to enter two numbers: a base and a divisor. The loop should print out the **quotient** and the **remainder ( % )**.

#####Exponents (can use multiplication)

Finally the exponent operator ( `**` ) in ruby. The loop should take in two numbers from the user: the first being the base number, the second the exponent. The loop should print out the exponent for the user.
