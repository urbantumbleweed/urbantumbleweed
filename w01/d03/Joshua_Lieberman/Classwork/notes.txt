Ex: Array
arr = [6, 7, 8, 9,]
[index:  0  1  2  3 ]

declare/set second element: second = arr[1]

push "5" into the array (last position): arr.push(5)
	or: arr << 22

remove last position from the array: arr.pop
	input: "arr"
	output (what pry returns): 42
	side effect: arr is changed

To save the popped number, you can assign the action a variable: ex. day = arr.pop

arr.shift: removes first element of array, (SE) array changes
arr.unshift(24): adds 24 to array's first position, (OP) the new array, (SE) array changes


Arrays:
Ordered, Generally contain similar elements

Hashes:
Order doesn't matter
Each piece of information is labelled
A Hash is a set of Key-Value Pair

Example:
info = { "key" => "value", "name" => "Hari", "age" => 50 }

info["name"] = "Hari"

to add:

info["occupation"] = "WDI"
