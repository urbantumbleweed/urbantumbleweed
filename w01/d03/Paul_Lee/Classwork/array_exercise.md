# Dumb User!

* Create an numeric array with some number of elements in it.
* Display it to the user




* Obtain from the user the following:
	* A number to insert into the array
	* An index value at which to insert the number into the array


* Insert the specified value into the specified index of the array


* That was well and good, but what if the user had inputted an index greater than the number of elements in our array? Less than 0?
# Test out your program that way and see what happens.
# PAUSE: Let's talk about this!
# -----------------------------
# Ok, so our user is kinda dumb. Let's make up for it by writing smarter code.
# Modify your code so that if the user enters an invalid index location, the program complains to the user and exits.



# PAUSE: Let's talk about this!
# -----------------------------
# Great! But our user is SO DUMB that they can't restart the program if they accidentally enter an invalid index!
# FINE, we'll just have to write even smarter code for our ever increasingly dumb user.
# Modify your code AGAIN so that if the user enters an invalid index, the program will ask the user to enter another index until it is valid. (While loop, anyone?)
